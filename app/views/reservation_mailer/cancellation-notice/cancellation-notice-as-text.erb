Hi there <%= @user.name %>,

Sad news: the session on "<%= @session.topic.name %>" for which you
had signed up has been cancelled.

<% if @custom_message.present? -%>
<%= @custom_message %>	

<% end -%>
If you'd like to sign up to take the class at a different time, you can
see a list of times it is offered here:

<%= url_for :action => "show", :controller => "topics", :id => @session.topic.id, :only_path => false %>

<%= render :partial => "reservation_details_text", :locals => { :except => [:where, :description, :documents], :title => "The Cancelled Reservation", :session => @session, :user => @user } -%>

Our sincere apologies for the inconvenience.
