<p>Hi there <%= @reservation.user.name %>,</p>

<p>The session on "<%= @reservation.session.topic.name %>" for which you
  had signed up has had some of its details changed. Please review the
  updated class information below.</p>
  
<%= render :partial => "reservation", :locals => {
  :session => @reservation.session,
  :user => @reservation.user,
  :title => "Your Updated Reservation"
  } -%>

<p>If you're unable to attend the class for any reason, please cancel your
reservation <%= link_to "here", :controller => "reservations", :only_path => false %>.

<p>If you'd like to sign up to take the class at a different time, you can
see a list of times it is offered  <%= link_to "here", :action => "show", :controller => "topics", :id => @reservation.session.topic.id, :only_path => false %>. (Be sure to cancel your existing
reservation first!)</p>
