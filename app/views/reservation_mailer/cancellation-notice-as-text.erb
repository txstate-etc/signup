Hi there <%= @reservation.user.name %>,

Sad news: the session on "<%= @reservation.session.topic.name %>" for which you
had signed up has been cancelled.

If you'd like to sign up to take the class at a different time, you can
see a list of times it is offered here:

<%= url_for :action => "show", :controller => "topics", :id => @reservation.session.topic.id, :only_path => false %>

----

The Cancelled Reservation

What: <%= @reservation.session.topic.name %>
When: <%= @reservation.session.time %>
Who:  <%= @reservation.user.name %>

----

Our sincere apologies for the inconvenience.
