<p>Hi there <%= @user.name %>,</p>

<p> 
  Now that the "<%= @session.topic.name %>" class you taught
  has ended it is a good time to record attendance, if you have not
  already done so. You may view or update the attendance record <%= link_to "here", attendance_url(@session), :only_path => false %>.
  <%- if @session.topic.certificate? -%>
    Note that students are only able to download certificates of completion if their attendance has been recorded.
  <%- end -%>
</p>

<% case @session.topic.survey_type 
  when Topic::SURVEY_INTERNAL %>
  <p>
    A link to the class survey has been sent to all attendees. 
    When completed, you will be able to view the results
    <%= link_to "here", session_survey_results_url( @session ), :only_path => false %>.
  </p>
<% when Topic::SURVEY_EXTERNAL %>
  <p>
    A link to the class survey has been sent to all attendees. 
    That survey can be found at <%= link_to nil, @session.topic.survey_url %>.
  </p>
<% end %>
