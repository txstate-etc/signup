<p>Hi there <%= @user.name %>,</p>

<p>A late reservation for <%= @reservation.session.topic.name %> has just been promoted off of the waiting list.
  Because this session is happening today, we wanted to give you a heads up in case you need to print extra course materials
  or make any other preparations. The reservation details are below. As always, you can view the current list of
  confirmed reservations <%= link_to "here", attendance_url(@reservation.session), :only_path => false %>.</p>

<%= render :partial => "reservation", :locals => {
  :session => @reservation.session,
  :user => @reservation.user
  } -%>

<p>You can use the attached ICS file to add the session to your calendar software.</p>
