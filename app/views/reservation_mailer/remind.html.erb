<p>Hi there <%= @user.name %>,</p>

<p>Just a friendly reminder: the "<%= @session.topic.name %>" class you signed up
for is coming up! If your plans have changed and you can no longer make it to the class,
or you need to cancel your reservation for any other reason, 
please do so <%= link_to "here", :controller => "reservations", :only_path => false %>.</p>

<%= render :partial => "reservation", :locals => {
  :session => @session,
  :user => @user
  } -%>

<p>You can use the attached ICS file to add the session to your calendar software.</p>
