Good news, <%= @reservation.user.name %>!

You were on the waiting list for "<%= @reservation.session.topic.name %>",
and space has become available! You have automatically been enrolled in the
class, and need take no additional action to attend.

If you won't be able to make it to this session after all, you can cancel
your reservation from the Training Reservation System:

<%= url_for :controller => "reservations", :only_path => false %>

<%= render :partial => "reservation_details_text", :locals => { :session => @reservation.session, :user => @reservation.user } -%>

You can use the attached ICS file to add the session to your calendar software.
