Hi there <%= @user.name %>,

Just a friendly reminder: the "<%= @session.topic.name %>"
class you signed up for is coming up! If your plans have changed 
and you can no longer make it to the class, or you need to cancel 
your reservation for any other reason, please do so from the 
Training Reservation System.

<%= url_for :controller => "reservations", :only_path => false %>

<%= render :partial => "reservation_details_text", :locals => { :session => @session, :user => @user } -%>

You can use the attached ICS file to add the session to your calendar software.
