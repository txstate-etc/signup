Signup
=========

The Signup tool allows users to signup for a workshop, presentation, meeting, or any other event requiring a reservation. Users will be sent automatic reminders about the event and allowed to cancel their reservation if needed.

Events in Signup can also contain a maximum participant limit. If the limit is reached users are automatically added to a waiting list. If an already confirmed user cancels the reservation, the people on the waiting list are confirmed as participants and sent a notification.

This application was generated with the [rails_apps_composer](https://github.com/RailsApps/rails_apps_composer) gem
provided by the [RailsApps Project](http://railsapps.github.io/).
